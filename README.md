# Omnifood Portfolio Project

## Purpose
This is a Portfolio Project for my employees and also for the checking progress mark of my IT path

 ## Technologies
This project uses the following technologies:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (But in that time it was written by teacher before I got knowledge about js)

## Usage
To use this website, simply scroll through the sections and explore the features of Omnifood. You can also use the navigation bar at the top to jump to a specific section. You can learn more about the service, the available plans, the cities where it operates, and the testimonials from happy customers. You can also sign up for a free trial by filling out a simple form.
During revising this little project you can see my knowledge in organizing the html structure, using of various technics such as flexbox or grid and the knowledge of responsive design.
